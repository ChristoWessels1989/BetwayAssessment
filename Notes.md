Tech used
- Entity framework with Code first approach
- Linq notation used for DB queries
- Solid principles Applied as far as i could 

SQL Generate note 
-DatabaseGenerate.sql is empty as the database will be generated by API using Entity framework Migrations 
-no Stored procs used. Data entry done by entity framework ( if required to show how to do a stored proc please let me know)

Getting to Production
-Will split out services on different items (games,Providers, Players , Wagers )
-use MQ inbetween services for updating of info
-maybe add a in memory database for things that do no change( themes in the example)
-add seperate controllers for player CRUD , wagers CRUD Etc

Notes
--did not follow any commiting messaging standard as this is usually specified by company
